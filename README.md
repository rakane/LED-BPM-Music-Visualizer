Arduino program that detects Beats from an 3.5 mm audio jack. [The source for the audio signal circuit and BPM filter code can be found here](https://www.hackster.io/Joao_Claro/arduino-beat-detector-d0a21f)
The program detects the beats in the song, and creates a waveform like wave down the string of LEDS.
